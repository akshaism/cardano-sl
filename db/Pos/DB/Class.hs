-- | A set of type classes which provide access to database.
--
-- 'MonadDBRead' contains reading and iterating capabilities. The
-- advantage of it is that you don't need to do any 'IO' to use it
-- which makes it suitable for pure testing.
--
-- 'MonadDB' is a superclass of 'MonadDB' and allows to modify
-- DB. Again, its purpose is to make it possible to use DB w/o IO
-- context.
--
-- 'MonadGState' contains functions to retrieve some data from
-- GState DB without knowledge of where this data is located (where in
-- code and where in DB, i. e. by which key). For example, if X wants
-- to get data maintained by Y and doesn't know about Y, it can use
-- 'MonadGState' (which is at pretty low level).
--
-- Described two classes have RocksDB implementation "DB.Rocks" and
-- pure one for testing "DB.Pure".
--
-- 'MonadBlockDBGeneric' contains functions which provide read-only
-- access to the Block DB.
-- For this DB we don't want to use 'MonadRealDB' for several reasons:
-- • we store blocks and undos in files, not in key-value storage;
-- • there are only three getters, so it's not a big problem to make all of
-- them part of type class;
-- • some parts of code need to access Block DB but they don't know actual
-- type of 'Block' and/or 'BlockHeader' as well as 'Undo', so 'MonadBlockDB'
-- is parameterized by these types.
